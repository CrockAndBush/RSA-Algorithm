# RSA-Algorithm

This repository is supposed to be an example of how RSA Algorithm work. In this project there is the RSA.java class that contains all the interesting things, and then there is the Main.java class in which I make 2 examples of RSA.java class usages ( with *encryption* and *decryption* ). ***This project is just an example*** ,so p and q are low numbers in between *50* and *100*.
